### **Project Title**: Namaste Travel – A Travel Booking and Management Platform
### **Description**:

**Namaste Travel** is a full-stack web application developed using the **MERN stack**—**MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **Node.js**—designed to streamline 
travel planning, booking, and management for both travelers and travel agencies. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for browsing travel packages, booking trips,
managing itineraries, and accessing travel services all in one place.

Users can explore various destinations, filter packages based on budget, duration, and type (adventure, honeymoon, family, etc.), and securely book their trips through 
an integrated payment gateway. Admins and travel agents can log in to manage package listings, respond to inquiries, and monitor bookings in real time.

The system features secure user authentication, responsive design, real-time data updates, and an intuitive dashboard for both users and admins. By leveraging 
the scalability and efficiency of the MERN stack, **Namaste Travel** delivers a seamless, end-to-end digital travel experience tailored for modern users.
